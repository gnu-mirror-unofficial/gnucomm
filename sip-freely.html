<p>Linphone, SFLphone, Jitsi, Ekiga and Twinkle on Debian&nbsp;GNU/Linux</p>
</div>

<p>This is a desktop on an ASUS Eee 1005HA.</p>

<p>It runs Debian GNU/Linux 6.x Squeeze with the KDE 4 Plasma Netbook
workspace. On the shortcut bar you can see <a href="#linphone">Linphone</a>,
SFLphone, Jitsi, Ekiga and Twinkle. These calling apps are <a
href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a> (free as in freedom, that
is). They are available at no cost too.</p>

<p>All support making calls using the open and vendor-independent standard SIP
for communication. They support voice calls and instant messaging. Linphone,
Jitsi and Ekiga even support video calls.</p>

<p>You probably have a phone in your pocket or nearby. In case of an emergency,
<a href="http://www.servalproject.org/">Serval</a> is able to make calls
through the phones of other Serval users around you &ndash; no need for extra
infrastructure. Serval is Free Software, but does not use SIP. You can use
<a href="#csipsimple">CSipSimple</a>, Linphone or Sipdroid on your Android or
Replicant phone to place calls using SIP.</p>

<p>Apps like CSipSimple and Linphone need to register with a SIP service to
find each other, so you can make a call. You can use <a
href="/software/sipwitch/sipwitch.html">GNU SIP Witch</a> to set up a SIP
service on your own internal Wi-Fi. This way you can stay mobile and private
while placing voice, chat or video calls either at the office or at home. A
great use of this is to have text alerts from systems come to your phone
&ndash; at no extra cost.</p>

<p>Why so many apps? One size does not fit all &ndash; GNU SIP Freely.</p>

<div class="pict wide left">
<img src="/software/sipwitch/images/linphone-on-debian-1.png" alt="&nbsp;[Netbook
desktop with Linphone ready to go]&nbsp;" />
</div>

<p>This is my desktop on my ASUS Eee 1005HA. I run Debian GNU/Linux 6.x Squeeze
with the KDE 4 Plasma Netbook desktop environment. In the top right corner you
can see the Linphone application start icon. Linphone supports audio, video and
chat using the open and vendor-independent standard SIP for communication. If
you look closely, you can see a smaller version in the top bar &ndash; that's
because I've already started Linphone.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<div class="pict wide left">
<img src="/software/sipwitch/images/linphone-on-debian-2.png" alt="&nbsp;[Netbook
desktop with Linphone running]&nbsp;" />
</div>

<p>Here I am, using the built-in web-cam on my netbook. In the top right
corner, you can see a chat window with messages sent through my Wi-Fi network
from my HTC Desire phone, where I also have a SIP client &ndash; that one is
called CSipSimple. Remember, using an open and vendor-independent standard
means you can use the apps that works best for you.</p>

<p>GNU SIP Witch makes it possible for both clients to find each other, so you
can talk, use video or chat. See screenshots of CSipSimple for Android
receiving a call using GNU SIP Witch as a service.</p>

<h2 id="csipsimple">CSipSimple for Android</h2>

<p>CSipSimple for Android supports audio and chat using the open and
vendor-independent standard SIP for communication.</p>

<p>The following are some screenshots to show you two people calling each other
using the CSipSimple app for Android as their software client. Both users are
on the same internal Wi-Fi network, and both are using GNU SIP Witch as their
service to find each other.</p>

<h3>Opening screen</h3>

<h3>Accounts</h3>

<div class="pict wide left" >
<img src="/software/sipwitch/images/CSipSimple-2.jpg" alt="&nbsp;[CSipSimple on Android - Accounts button]&nbsp;" />
</div>
<p>The menu-button on your device will show &ldquo;Accounts&rdquo;, which is
the place to go to add GNU SIP Witch as a service.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<div class="pict wide left">
<img src="/software/sipwitch/images/CSipSimple-3.jpg" alt="&nbsp;[CSipSimple
on Android - Add an account]&nbsp;" />
</div>
<p>An account &ndash; &ldquo;David hjemme&rdquo; or &ldquo;David home&rdquo;
&ndash; is already added. The green bar and the word &ldquo;Registered&rdquo;
shows the device is connected to the GNU SIP Witch service. To add an account,
use the button &ldquo;+ Add account&rdquo;.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<div class="pict wide left">
<img src="/software/sipwitch/images/CSipSimple-4.jpg" alt="&nbsp;[CSipSimple
on Android - Account settings]&nbsp;" />
</div>
<p>The settings for the account named &ldquo;David hjemme&rdquo; or
&ldquo;David home&rdquo; &ndash; an account name you choose, the user name to
login, the IP address or domain name of the server where the GNU SIP Witch
service is running, and finally the password to login.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<h3>Accepting or declining a call</h3>

<div class="pict wide right">
<img src="/software/sipwitch/images/CSipSimple-5.jpg" alt="&nbsp;[CSipSimple
on Android - Accept or decline a call]&nbsp;" />
</div>
<p>Oh, look! Haakon is calling! He is also registered to the GNU SIP Witch
service, but is using an HTC Desire phone with CSipSimple. To accept the call,
David needs to slide the green button. To decline the call, David can use the
red button.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>CSipSimple is stable and easy to use. There are many other apps that support
video, audio and chat using the open and vendor-independent standard SIP for
communication. Remember, using an open and vendor-independent standard means
you can use those apps that work best for you.</p>
