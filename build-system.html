<p><em>This was written in 2010. In 2017, the GNU Telephony project primarily
uses CMake.</em></p>

<h2 id="make-in-place">Make-in-Place</h2>

<p>The GNU Telephony project now has a new &ldquo;make-in-place&rdquo; build
system to build directly from a SVN checkout of our entire build tree. This can
now be found on the Sourceforge SVN repository for GNU Telephony (<code>svn co
https://gnutelephony.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnutelephony/trunk</code>).
What this allows one to do is configure, build, and run all parts of GNU
Telephony without having to do partial <code>make install</code> for dependent
libraries or the need to create &ldquo;fake roots&rdquo; if one is a guest on
a machine without root access.</p>

<p>Make-in-place uses existing pkgconfig, automake, and libtool functionality
to achieve this, along with a master top level configure script and Makefile.
This makes it very easy to deploy automated compile farms, to generate embedded
&amp; cross-compile build profiles, or to develop on hosts where
different/conflicting versions of existing packages we offer may already be
installed.</p>

<p>A special category of helper scripts are found in the config directory for
each package. These <code>.ex</code> files are used to indicate how to
translate pkg-config directory references, how to link additional headers,
etc.</p>

<p>It is possible to use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)">Eclipse</a> with
Make-in-place.</p>

<h2 id="using-Eclipse">Using Eclipse</h2>

<p>There are two ways one can use Eclipse with GNU Telephony.</p>

<p>The first method involves importing each package, perhaps directly from CVS
from GNU Telecom Subsystem (GnuComm) on gnu.org, or using subclipse to import
from our Sourceforge SVN repository. This method one can build code either as a
local C++ &ldquo;make&rdquo; project, or perhaps even as an automake-managed
project supported by newer versions of <abbr title="C/C++ Development Toolkit
(IBM)">CDT</abbr> and the automake support plugins.</p>

<p>Using this method, each package is maintained as a standalone entity. This
means if dependent libraries are needed, they must be installed first. One
might also have to build <code>make install</code> targets to get needed
libraries out for other parts of GNU Telephony. There is a second approach
possible, however, which can be used in conjunction with our Make-in-place
build scripts.</p>

<p>To use Eclipse with Make-in-place builds, you would start with a clean
checkout of the entire build tree. You would then do the following steps:</p>

<ul>
 <li>run the master <code>./configure</code> script, selecting the profile you
wish to use (or using generic).</li>

 <li>create an empty Eclipse project for each GNU Telephony package (ucommon,
sipwitch, etc) you wish to build. These should be created as empty C++
&ldquo;standard make&rdquo; projects.</li>

 <li>import the project using &ldquo;import from filesystem&rdquo;, selecting
the directory where each package exists in the master make-in-place build tree
checkout for each empty project you created.</li>

 <li>run the top level <code>make</code> in make-in-place to get dependent
libraries initially built.</li>
</ul>

<p>You now have projects filled with local Eclipse-managed copies of the
make-in-place build tree. They are configured to use include files from the
make-in-place tree, and to link their libraries from there. You can now use
Eclipse for all your primary editing and make. You will need to export back to
the build tree, and run <code>make</code> there to get dependent libraries to
relink with changes (such as ucommon for sipwitch) if they are modified,
however.</p>

<p>There is also an Eclipse filesync plugin to automatically export changes
back to the original file system/make-in-place directory tree. You can add a
make target to run make from there to force the library to rebuild in the
make-in-place tree from within Eclipse and automate this part.</p>
