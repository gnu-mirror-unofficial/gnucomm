<div class="announcement"><p>GNU SIP Witch Introduced</p>
<p>SIP Witch is an official package of the GNU Project as of August 10th 2007.
GNU SIP Witch is also part of GNU Telephony & the GNU Telecom subsystem.</p>
<p>GNU SIP Witch is a call and registration server for the SIP protocol. As a call
server it services call registration for SIP devices and destination routing
through SIP gateways.  GNU SIP Witch does not perform codec operations or media
proxying and thereby enables SIP endpoints to directly peer negotiate call
setting and process peer to peer media streaming even when when multiple SIP
Witch call nodes at multiple locations are involved.  This means GNU SIP Witch
operates without introducing additional media latency or offering a central
point for media capture.</p>
<p>GNU SIP Witch is designed to support network scaling of telephony services,
rather than the heavily compute-bound solutions we find in use today.  This
means a call node has a local authentication/registration database, and this
will be mirrored, so that any active call node in a cluster will be able to
accept and service a call.  This allows for the possibility of live failover
support in the future as well.</p>
<p>GNU SIP Witch is not a SIP "router", and does not try to address the same
things as a project like iptel "Ser".  GNU SIP Witch is being designed to
create on-premise SIP telephone systems, telecenter servers, and Internet
hosted SIP telephone systems.  One important feature will include use of URI
routing to support direct peer to peer calls between service domains over the
public internet without needing mediation of an intermediary "service provider"
so that people can publish and call sip: uri's unconstrained.  GNU SIP Witch is
about freedom to communicate and the removal of artifical barriers and
constraints whether imposed by monopoly service providers or by governments.</p>
<p>GNU SIP Witch depends on the UCommon library, which may merge with and become
GNU Common C++ 2.0 later this year or early next year.  CVS for and new
distributions of UCommon will be found in the GNU Telecom project on an interim
basis until then.  GNU SIP Witch also uses libeXosip2 and GNU oSIP, and these
may be found at their respective sites.  GNU SIP Witch is licensed under the
GNU General Public License V3 or later.</p>

<h3 id="Whatis">What is GNUCOMM?</h3>
<p>GNUCOMM is the Telecom subsystem of the GNU Project.  The goal of GNUCOMM
is to deliver scalable telephony services for current and next generation
telephone networks using entirely free software on the GNU
system.</p>
<h3 id="Bayonne">What is GNU Bayonne?</h3>
<p>GNU Bayonne is the telephone server of the GNU Project.  It offers scalable
media and scripted voice application services for SIP and H.323 networks as
well as for traditional PSTN and ISDN services.  GNU Bayonne may be used
stand-alone to deliver carrier hosted or premise application services behind
existing switching equipment and standard compliant VOIP platforms, or together
with GNU SIP Witch and perhaps Troll to offer complete VOIP phone systems.</p>
<h3 id="SIPWitch">What is GNU SIP Witch?</h3>
<p>GNU SIP Witch is the VOIP call, provisioning, and feature server of the GNU 
Project.  It offers network scalable services through SIP.  GNU SIP Witch only 
offers registration services and only performs destination selection and 
routing. GNU SIP Witch uses SIP to resolve media streaming by endpoints.  This
means GNU SIP Witch is neither inhibited by restrictive codec patents nor 
imposes additional media latency in VOIP networks.</p>
<h3 id="overview">GNUComm System Design Overview</h3>
<p><a HREF="overview.html" NAME="overview">Version 0.6 of the GNUComm System Design Overview</a> is now available.  It is currently being maintained by rsb.  Check it out.</p>
