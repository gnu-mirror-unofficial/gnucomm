<p>GNU Telephony is a meta project dedicated to the development and promotion
of the use of free software for telephony. GNU Telephony is used to directly
support the GNU Common C++ family of libraries and telephony application
servers such as GNU Bayonne, which are part of the GNU Project, as well as
other packages that we regularly use. We will also support several <a
href="projects-2006.html">special projects</a> from this site, including <a
href="cape.html">CAPE runtime libraries</a>, <a href="secure-call.html">Secure
Calling</a> and <a href="open-embedded.html">GNU Telephony Open Embedded</a>.
An overall project <a href="roadmap-2006">roadmap</a> may also be found on this
wiki.</p>

<h2>Latest News</h2>

<p>GNU SIP Witch is our newly announced VoIP call, provisioning, and feature
server of the GNU Project. It offers network-scalable services through SIP. GNU
SIP Witch only offers registration services and only performs destination
selection and routing. GNU SIP Witch uses SIP to resolve media streaming by
endpoints. This means GNU SIP Witch is neither inhibited by restrictive codec
patents nor imposes additional media latency in VoIP networks.</p>

<p>New <a href="build-system.html">Make-in-place</a> build system introduced
for GNU Telephony. What this allows one to do is configure and build all parts
of GNU Telephony without the need to do a partial &ldquo;make install&rdquo;
for dependent libraries or the need to create &ldquo;fake roots&rdquo; if one
is a guest on a machine without root access.</p>

<p>UCommon 0.4.0 was released on June 29th as a new package licensed using the
GNU GPLv3. While we are re-using the ucommon name, this release is not directly
related to any prior releases. The latest 0.5.0 release is available for
download at [1] <em>(unavailable)</em>.</p>

<p>UCommon is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate using C++
design patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems
using uClibc along with POSIX threading support. For this reason, UCommon
disables language features that consume memory or introduce runtime overhead,
such as RTTI and exception handling, and assumes one will mostly be linking
applications with other pure C-based libraries rather than using the overhead
of the standard C++ library and other similar class frameworks.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>

<p>GNU Bayonne is the telephony server of GNU Telephony and the GNU Project.
The production release of GNU Bayonne&nbsp;1 is 1.2.15. GNU Bayonne supports
IVR scripting using hardware from Voicetronix, Dialogic, Aculab, CAPI drivers,
and Quicklink drivers under GNU/Linux. GNU Bayonne&nbsp;1 can integrate Perl
and Python applications, and has been commercially deployed in production use
for several years.</p>

<p>The stable release is GNU Bayonne 2, the current release series is 1.5.x,
and currently supports SIP, H.323, and Voicetronix drivers. GNU Bayonne 2 can
be used on 32 and 64 bit GNU/Linux systems, various BSD systems, MacOS&nbsp;X,
and Microsoft Windows. Work is in progress on support for Dialogic, Aculab, and
Synway hardware. Other drivers will be added as time and community support
allows to be developed.</p>

<p>The stable release currently performs script-driven IVR applications written
in GNU Bayonne's native scripting language, as well as access, conversion, and
playing of audio from remote URL's. The stable release also performs basic
switching interconnect functions, including tone detection and DTMF
regeneration, that are needed for basic gateway operations. The latest release
can also operate as a SIP proxy and register for external SIP devices, which
can be used to build phone systems and gateways. The stable release supports
integration of external Perl, Python, PHP, C#, and Java applications; the
ability to perform XML query operations and voice rendering of BayonneXML
documents with a web site; and a build-in webserver offering HTML pages to
browsers and standard-compliant XMLRPC services for programmatic control and
integration. XMLRPC is also offered as a local Unix domain socket if one does
not wish to expose the server to remote access, and may be offered over SIP
transport as well soon.</p>

<p>The GNU Telephony <a href="open-embedded.html">Open Embedded</a> project has
recently had its first success, in building installable packages of GNU Common
C++ and GNU ccRTP for GNU/Linux on ARM. These packages are built for use on
iPAQ's, either using GPE or OPIE. I hope to soon port an initial softphone
client like SFLphone and/or Twinkle to iPAQ.</p>

<h2>How we license our code</h2>

<p>In GNU Telephony, we generally license under the GNU GPL version 2 or later.
Some of our C++ frameworks and libraries may use the same Runtime Library
Exception used for libstdc++ in the GNU Compiler Collection.</p>
