<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Good evening from Norway! :)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	The log of the first GNU Telephony meeting of 2012 can be found at http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/GNU_Telephony_Meeting_2012-03-26
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	The log from the second meeting will be at http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/GNU_Telephony_Meeting_2012-04-23
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Some updates since last time
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	GNU Telephony has set up a new Mantis installation at bugs.gnutelephony.org.
<strong>thomas____</strong>	hey... i didn't joined last time...just saaw the reminder i my stream and want to have a look around
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	We've tried to have our blog included into planet.debian.org, but for the time being we are not considered Debian developers.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Hi, Thomas - welcome! :)
<strong>thomas____</strong>	hey  :-)
<strong>thomas____</strong>	so simonlou is missing?
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	So far. :)
<strong>thomas____</strong>	and dyfet .-)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Yep.
<strong>thomas____</strong>	i just have a small lok to protokol from last time
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	In the screenshot / video tutorial department, I've managed to add three small articles: http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/CSipSimple_for_Android http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/Linphone_through_GNU_SIP_Witch_on_Debian and http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/GNU_SIP_Freely
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Great, Thomas!
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Squeeze didn't like it, but I've added all 2012 months and week numbers under the Activity plan. He argues there is no point in having a lot of empty weeks, and I agree. I just don't like to look up calender items many times, and now everyone can add things with little effort. :)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	The GNU Free Call roadmap with milestones and activity plan is at http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/GNU_Free_Call_Roadmap
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	here
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Hello, Simon! :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	hi
<strong>thomas____</strong>	nice :-)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	I've just added some info items. :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ok
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	And Thomas has joined us! :D
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	i'm logging now
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Great! I have logging too, in case we need a backup.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	To recap, I've just said we now have a new bug tracker at bugs.gnutelephony.org , three small screenshot articles are in the wiki, and the activity plan awaits our activity. :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ah nice
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Are there any upcoming conferences we should attend that didn't get metioned last time? I've heard video will soon be available from LibrePlanet2012.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	While you think about that, I will say something about donations.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	not that i know of, but i don't keep track either ;)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Okay, perhaps we can say something about this in the next meeting.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	David suggests May 21 for the third meeting
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	good for me
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Good for me too. :)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	The FSF's Working Together for Free Software Fund is a way to give donations to the FSF and direct the donation to your favourite project.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	So far GNU Octave has done really well, and we haven't. I took a look at their web site, and they have a nice donation form and a screenshot on the front page.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	would be simple to hook that in i imagine
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Their donation form has $50 as the default, and we have $25 on "our" page at the FSF.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Well, Mediawiki requires a form extension.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Anyway, I've reorganized the the front page at www.gnutelephony.org. There is now a very visible orange donation box in the top right corner, a CSipSimple screenshot just below.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	It's a start. :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	cool *checks it out*
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	very obvious ;)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Directed donations work this way: a project signs a contract with the FSF. The money does not go to the project, but to the FSF, which is a legitimate foundation.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	:)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	and then they redirect that project-specific donation to the project? (restating to be clear)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	No, not as such. By supplying receits and other needed documentation for our expenses, we can ask the FSF to support us.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	If a project stops, then the FSF must use the donated amounts to further Free Software.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	This is different from say, Kickstarter.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Hello, David! :)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Hi!
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	We are just about to start talking about promoting donations and discuss thinks like Kickstarter.
<strong>dyfet</strong>		cool
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ah ok
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	How can we promote our new, shiny orange donation box - any suggestions? :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	donation links to the page, maybe make a specific page to handle it
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	I didn't understand that
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	make a Donations page, and have info there (link to it on the main page), and then c&amp;p the link to the Donations page here and there
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	(oh, and you can get rid of that /index.php/ stuff easily ;)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	hey dyfet 
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Hmm...you mean on the wiki site?
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	yes
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Well,  at the time they did not have rewrite rules on ibliblio...
<strong>dyfet</strong>		And I think we have external links anchored to them now...
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	nm then. 
<strong>dyfet</strong>		So I am not sure it is easy...well...at least the rewrite rules issue remains...
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	If we add form capability to Mediawiki, then we can have a nice form like GNU Octave - it worked for them. :)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Well, if there is an extension for it, it should be easy to add
<strong>dyfet</strong>		That much we can do :)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Forms and some other pages discuss this.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	side issue anyway (i tend to do that, sorry). why i was suggesting a separate page is because the front page looks really busy, and it would be nice to have the info clear and not distracted by other things.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ah cool
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Just need the link to download the extension...
<strong>dyfet</strong>		simonlnu: true...maybe this is a good time to discuss reorg of the wiki site in general too
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+1 Noted for next time
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Forms_Inputs
<strong>dyfet</strong>		+1 agreed
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Great, Simon! :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CustomUserCreateForm
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Okay, this will make it easier to donate. How to promote?
<strong>dyfet</strong>		simonlnu: I think we have to upgrade our mediawiki for it I think also....okay, it will be a little bit longer :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	stick the link in your sig on various sites, e.g.. in READMEs, 
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+1
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Github
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	and other files where relevant. 
<strong>dyfet</strong>		simonlnu: CustomUserCreateForm is compatible...
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Welcome, Squeeze! :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	hi [squeeze] 
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	we hi @all got confused with the timezones finally
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	well*
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	i'm sorry that i missed it
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	We have talked some about why the FSF's Working Together for Free Software fits well with us. Another thing is that people who donate to the FSF get tax benefit in the USA, and other paper work. :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	that's important for certain types of donators
<strong>dyfet</strong>		We do have this problem with timezones ;)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	timezones suck :p
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	The big donation question was if we should look into Kickstarter or similar. Personally, I fear we raise expectations about quick results if/when we reach the stated target amount. If we don't deliver, then people might grumble about what happened to their money, which is transferred once the target goal is reached.
<strong>dyfet</strong>		HaakonME: Well...I can only think about dispora when you say that...
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	yeh really
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	There was a heated article and discussion last week on /.
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Well, we do not want to do what they did...I think that is clear
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	agreed
<strong>dyfet</strong>		So I understand Haakon's caution
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	flattr?
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	What's that?
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	+1
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	flattr.com
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	(i have no experience witt flattr, so if i'm full of it, please say so)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	with*
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	an alternate to paypal, AIUI
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I had not heard of it before either
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	also handles donations and similar
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Okay, we can check it out. Noted.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	then we can avoid the "target goal" stuff and not put expectations into people
<strong>dyfet</strong>		agreed
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	As David knows, I've tried to get government and others interested, and have had some initial success - they have discussed us - but so far unsuccessfully.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	and, if wanted, we can do the fsf thing too, as an alternate (for people/orgs that require a receipt)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+1
<strong>dyfet</strong>		And my second nsf grant submission also died....
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ah damn
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Too bad
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	always next time ;)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		appearently the govt is more interested in projects that promote security through spying rather than grants that promote security from it....
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	hmm. kinda figures.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	brb, making coffee
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	aren't they supposed to be impartial? ;)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Okay, let's first push the FSF fund, and see what we find out about other channels next time. We have a request from RMS.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	sweet. can't get cooler than that
<strong>dyfet</strong>		+1 agreed fsf fund effort
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	affirmative here too
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	His e-mail signature says no to Skype, then links to a page about in the FSF Software directory. This does not make sense, and he wants a better page.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	I've started this - http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/GNU_SIP_Freely
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Hmm...I like this
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	can easily make a page in the wiki to handle stuff like that.. like you did :)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		And I always did like your "GNU SIP Freely" as a slogan
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	He wants a page that describes alternatives to Skype and other proprietary telephony software.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Thanks, David! I think we came up with that one together. :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ah yes, that would a perfect page for the project :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	where better? ;)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Just needs a donate link? ;)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	;-)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	;)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Okay, I've linked the CSipSimple, Linphone and GNU SIP Witch articles into it, but if some of you can do screenshots of the other apps, that would be great.
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	i have jitsi installed and working, so i can do that
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+1
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	I will try to do Sipdroid with video, but I haven't tried it yet.
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I can do twinkle and sflphone
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+2
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Okay, I think we have this covered. Let's move on to gnunet.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	David, you suggested using gnunet for peer-to-peer dns.
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Can you say something about this?
<strong>dyfet</strong>		This I only head about recently.  They have implimented peer to peer dns.  I believe you create and exchange .xxx.gnunet addresses
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Since we do use dns for resolving sip uri's, this means we can do something like sip:someone@something.somewhere.gnunet and maybe not have too much work :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	omg
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	:D
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+1
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I am not sure how they do the interchange, I have to set it up and try it out :)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Okay, let us know next time if time allows. :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	http://simon.kisikew.org/src/img/jitsi_screenshot.jpg
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Okay...and of course, if it is pure dns, we can do things with it with friendica too :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	yep
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Nice! :)
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	Next item, packaging sflphone for debian, jitsi tutorial
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"i highlighted the sip contact ;)"
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	sflphone is packaged for debian
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Is it??  Last I checked I did not find it...
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/sflphone-gnome
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"yup. dunno if it's in squeeze or not (not you [squeeze] you know what i mean ;)"
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	:D
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	oh ok
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	It is. :)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Ah, they are behind 1.0 release though...but still, cool!  Maybe we will have a later package in our archive :)  and if needed a backport to squeeze...
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	"Simon, can you do a Jitsi tutorial in relation to Sipwitch?"
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"i suppose. there isn't much to it, it's dead easy."
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	"1.0.1 is in testing already, 102 in sid"
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	+1
<strong>dyfet</strong>		they have 1.01 in wheezy...0.9.8 in squeeze...
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"for things like this, it's best to have the latest stuff. having a backport in b.d.o would be good"
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I dont know why I didnt see it before...
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I think 1.0.2 has latest zrtp code, though.  So yes, for that reason...we can do it off the sid package...."
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	:)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"maybe you filed it in your ""too old"" category :P"
<strong>HaakonME</strong>	"Okay, guys, I've got to go, but remaining items are friends.gnutelephony.org public portal, chat room, hosting with hipatia. Good night, everyone! :)"
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	g'night HaakonME
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	good night
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	:)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	friends. was going to be a friendica instance, right?
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	yes
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Yes
<strong>dyfet</strong>		It made sense :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	a chat room can be easily set up with a jabber install
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I was hoping we might have Charles here....
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"hook it up with BOSH in jappixmini, and ding, we have a chat, *and* friendica"
<strong>dyfet</strong>		simonlnu: we actually have a jabber.gnutelephony.org...
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	nice
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"perfect. i should hook up with that then, from here ;)"
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	hosting with hipatia... so how is that set up?
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I was concerned on using the hipatia hosting when they were...down for so long...
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ah yeh
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I had a hipatia experience like that several years ago with my journal wiki :)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I think that was the last thing Haakon had on the list for today...
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	ok
<strong>dyfet</strong>		do we have any other items?
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I think squeeze had proposed #gnutelephony on freenode
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"checking.. ah yes, that would be a good idea"
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	well that would be nice
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Agreed...who wants to register it? :)
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	the admin?
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	you?
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	:-)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I can :)
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Doing the form now :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"oh, there was some talk of setting up a forum. personally, i'd be more in favour of having the friendica instance, as it suits the project better. maybe later we can set one up, if anyone asks."
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	+1
<strong>dyfet</strong>		"Yes, friends.gnutelephony.org sounds so very right too :)"
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	it does
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	maybe with a nice introduction page (if thats possible)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"friendica supports having an home.html page, we can easily do that"
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	really?
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	just save it in the top-most fd dir
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	"nice, thanks for the hint :-)"
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	it's shown on login and some other top-most pages
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	"ack-grep -a 'home.html' ;)"
<strong>dyfet</strong>		sent in request for #gnutelephony channel :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	yay
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Next meeting 5/21 in #gnutelephony? :)
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	sound good to me
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	perfect
<strong>dyfet</strong>		any other things or are we done for today?
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	too bad i missed it
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	that's it i guess
<strong>dyfet</strong>		I have come to appreciate we cannot have these later for its late for Haakon...
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	i think that's it
<strong>dyfet</strong>		Maybe we will have adhoc mini meetings too....:)  that may cover time better
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	*nods*
<strong>[squeeze]</strong>	well see you all at #gnutelephony
<strong>simonlnu</strong>	woot
<strong>dyfet</strong>		already there :)
