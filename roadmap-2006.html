</div></div>

<p>I have recently made available a number of interesting releases from things
that had actually been in development from a long time ago, and I will later
this summer bring out some entirely new things. I wish to explain how these
releases relate to, and what is my overall roadmap for, GNU Telephony for the
next several years.</p>

<h2 id="bayonnexml">BayonneXML and web services</h2>

<p>The last two point releases of <a href="/software/bayonne/bayonne.html">GNU
Bayonne</a>&nbsp;2 have focused on enabling Bayonne to be both a producer and
consumer of XML documents. This included the re-introducing of <a
href="/software/bayonne/bayonneXML.html">BayonneXML</a> to allow GNU Bayonne
servers to query and process call sessions under the control of web-served
documents. I see XML documents as the way to enable common publishing and
presentation of documents, whether on the web for browsers in XHTML, for
editing through ODT, for the visually impaired in Daisy, and VoiceXML and/or
BayonneXML for presentation to telephone callers. Produce once and distribute
everywhere.</p>

<p>Bayonne server bindings offered new opportunities for introducing new
application service with GNU Bayonne. Now that we are working with BayonneXML
again, I also wish to introduce Bayonne Daisy as a server binding for the <a
href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/alexandria">GNU Alexandria</a> package.
There also remains a lot of work to make BayonneXML more fully consistent with
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml/">CCXML</a>/<a
href="https://evolution.voxeo.com/docs/platforms.jsp">CallXML</a>.</p>

<p>GNU Bayonne 2 web services provide a model both for system management and
for integrating GNU Bayonne with other application services. Initially I have
introduced several .html status pages which automatically refresh, and hence
can be used to monitor the server, and a new XML dialect, <a
href="/software/bayonne/serverResponse-spec.html">serverResponse</a>, which
allows one to send a GET request to known URI's, with optional query arguments,
and retrieve a XML response document which is simpler than the POST-driven <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec">XMLRPC</a> reply system. In the future I will
also be adding XMLRPC to GNU Bayonne web services. The existing web service
also needs support for authentication.</p>

<p>GNU Bayonne web services makes it possible to telephony-enable existing
applications, either from other web services, or by using common scripting
languages. Along with the existing <code>Bayonne::Libexec.pm</code> module, and
similar modules for Python, Java, C#, and php that also exist, I will be
writing a <code>Bayonne::Webservice.pm</code> (and
<code>Bayonne::xmlrpc.pm</code>) module for different scripting languages to
future GNU Bayonne distributions to make it easier to write such applications
that integrate with GNU Bayonne.</p>

<h2 id="framework">Frameworks and Platforms</h2>

<p>There has been some effort being made in an entirely new sub-project, <a
href="open-embedded.html">GNU Telephony Open Embedded</a>. This work is focused
on making the core GNU Telephony frameworks available for two uses; for those
developing softphone applications for handheld devices, potentially using <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100819043722/http://gpe.handhelds.org/">
GPE</a>, <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050112061446/http://opie.handhelds.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/">OPIE</a>,
or QTOPIA; and for deploying embedded servers (including things like GNU
Bayonne) on appliances.</p>

<p>With regard to our framework libraries, there are specific goals for each.
These goals are consistent both with features that have been missing but deemed
vital to add, and with addressing needs suggested by other goals.</p>

<p>In <a href="/software/commoncpp/commoncpp.html">GNU Common C++</a>, there
will be work on introducing <code>SSLStream</code> (and later
<code>SSLSocket</code>) in the <code>ccext2</code> library, using openSSL. The
existing <code>URLStream</code> class will then be rewritten to support
<code>SSLStream</code> and to support SSL websites. From the perspective of GNU
Bayonne, binders like BayonneXML which consume websites will eventually be
rewritten to use <code>URLStream</code> rather than depend on external
libexec-based <code>xml-fetch</code>, to increase performance. Other uses will
include support for creation of services which depend on secure communications,
and hence support for things like key management and encryption will also be
added to the GNU Common C++ framework directly.</p>

<p>In <a href="/software/ccaudio/ccaudio.html">GNU ccAudio2</a>, some work has
been completed on improving plugin support for codecs, including those which
have irregular packet sizes. This work will be used to modify the
<code>AudioStream</code> class with methods that allow a codec to pull data and
synchronize I/O to packet boundaries. An example of this will be found in the
interaction of the future MPG audio codec plugin with the audio file streaming
class.</p>

<p>GNU ccAudio2 now includes primitive resample support. This allows audiotool
to do basic &ldquo;rate conversion&rdquo;. This needs to be integrated with a
smart resampler algorithm. In addition, I will be adding support for generating
false audio positioning in GNU ccAudio2's existing capability to convert mono
to stereo audio. This will be very useful in future telephony softphone client
work. There are many gaps remaining in GNU ccAudio2, including fsk/fax
decoding, which still needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>In <a href="/software/ccrtp/ccrtp.html">GNU ccRTP</a>, I am going to look at
how we can simplify templates, so that we do not have to have entirely separate
templates for IPV4, IPV6, etc. I may also look at introducing some hard-coded
classes for certain common RTP profiles. However, we do not have any large
issues in GNU ccRTP, that I see, only those that will either make the library
easier to use, or better suited for embedded applications.</p>

<p>On the Microsoft Windows platform, I recently re-organized <a
href="cape.html">CAPE</a>, and broke compatibility with past releases of
CAPE-dependent software in the process. This was done to standardize the naming
convention we used for DLL's so that versioning of API's would be better
represented. I also used it as an opportunity to introduce a bunch of
additional libraries as part of CAPE for building GNU ccAudio2 codec support,
including Speex, and a stand-alone GSM audio DLL. The existing .dsp project
files for GNU Bayonne can be made to work with the new CAPE releases by
adjusting the link library names.</p>

<h2 id="past-services">Migration of Past Services</h2>

<p>Recently I did a partial rewrite of the globalcall driver stack to try and
eliminate issues with call failure states. This became 1.2.16, which still has
one open issue with handling of disconnect on outbound calls, and included the
new SNMP module. I intend to resolve that issue this or next weekend, and then
have a new release (1.2.17). Afterward, I will be focusing on migrating
Dialogic driver support to Bayonne2.</p>

<h2 id="new-services">Introduction of New Services</h2>

<p>Many new areas of development are still in my workshop, and so have not yet
made it into software I have released. However, I am very shortly going to
introduce the first of what will become several new free software generic
Internet media servers through GNU Telephony. None of these break new ground
directly, although they are engineered to my expectations, and are meant to be
used for experimentation in convergence of telephony, Internet radio, IMS, and
IPTV, over the next several years. Free media requires freedom in the tools
which propagate it, as well as freedom in the formats it is encoded in, and the
infrastructure it is carried on.</p>

<p>The first of these new servers will be the Nijmegen audio, video, and
internet radio streaming server, which implements the icecast protocol, and
supports plugins as media sources. Initial releases will be available sometime
on or before August 1st, when I will demonstrate this new server during ClueCon
in Chicago. Later this year I am introducing a RTSP based generic streaming
media server.</p>

<p>Because it is vital to our enterprise vision for GNU Telephony, a third
effort will be made to introduce Troll gateways, and this time again as a
standalone server. This will focus on the idea of tightly coupling the RTP
stack to the telephony device for optimal gateway I/O performance. The other
advantage this offers is being able to offload transcoding to the telephony
card, and presenting those codecs which the device natively supports. This is
from our vision of optimizing system load and maximizing system capacity. There
are already other gateways that support such functionality through extensive
transcoding.</p>

<p>Part of this enterprise vision focuses on separating telephony into three
parts; a gateway for when dealing with PSTN/ISDN trunking services, an
application/media server (GNU Bayonne), and a call control/session
manager/registrar/call server. For H.323 networks, <a
href="http://www.gnugk.org/">GNUGK</a> is already an excellent resource. For
SIP there are things like SIPX and Vocal, although each breaks up the
functionality into separate micro services. I have thought about introducing a
new kind of SIP proxy/registrar that focuses on peer-to-peer audio while
managing SIP sessions, call state, call groups, etc.</p>

<p>Another important consideration has been in developing applications with GNU
Telephony. Part of this will be addressed in several long term applications
that are currently being developed, including a model Bayonne-based SIP
telecenter. Other applications we will look at is large scale GNU Bayonne
hosted voice mail and ACD systems. Some of these projects have waited for the
introduction of GNU Bayonne web services.</p>

<h2 id="long-term">Our long term vision for VoIP</h2>

<p>There are several areas I consider important to the future of telephony and
collaborative communications, including the question of the telephone handset,
an instrument traditionally of low quality audio reception. The interest in GNU
Telephony Open Embedded, and in migrating client softphone development to
embedded devices in general, is related to our goal of eliminating the
traditional handset altogether.</p>

<p>Part of this idea involves re-thinking audio as it relates to telephony.
While some have focused on questions like narrow-band vs wide-band, and hence
overall quality of audio at the expense of bandwidth, I have chosen to focus on
something different; how we can treat audio as a &ldquo;spatial&rdquo;
environment for the listener, and so I have been experimenting with false
spatial positioning through regenerated and artificially time shifted
stereo.</p>

<p>The real value of this comes into play when considering audio mixing for
audio conferencing. The traditional way to do this is to route all the
participants audio into a common conference server, mixing the audio together,
and feeding each user the mixed result, minus their own audio.</p>

<p>By maintaining multiple peer connections at the VoIP client (VoIP telephone
phone devices), it is possible to mix audio at the end point rather than at the
server. This means each connection can also be given a separate and distinct
false spatial position in the resulting false stereo audio that you then hear.
It is far easier and more natural to have a multiparty conference without
confusion when each speaker &ldquo;appears&rdquo; to be in a different spatial
location than when you mix their signals together at some central point.</p>

<p>This also relates to the question of latency, which, particularly for VoIP,
is a very important question. In current VoIP networks, latency can often
approach 1/4 of a second, which is enough to be disturbing and ineffective.
Each hop through a server, such as for mixing, or spoke-wheel configured
centralized networks, adds significantly to latency, especially on poorly
designed software, and hence even further reduces the quality of the call.
Peer-to-peer calling, besides offering greater privacy, also reduces latency by
removing intermediary servers.</p>

<p>Other areas I have been exploring include ways to provide better security
and privacy in VoIP, and not just by securing the audio channel with
encryption. Given recent events, I have come to consider it vital to hide even
basic signaling and call session information. In this area, I have looked at
ideas like forward publishing and caching SIP location information through
peer-to-peer networks for direct calling when trying to locate people, rather
than depending on traditional SIP registrars and proxies which introduce
signaling information at central control and intercept points. My long term
goal in VoIP is to introduce massively scalable and secure peer-to-peer calling
services with a focus on endpoint development and which have no centralized
control points.</p>

<h2 id="legal">Legal issues and Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Of course, much of our vision for private, secure, and anonymous VoIP
calling, including anonymous PSTN gateways, are things which I happen to
consider a basic human right to privacy, and which fall well outside the scope
of what will be permitted under new surveillance mandates such as those driven
by <a href="https://www.cybertelecom.org/voip/fcccalea.htm">CALEA</a>. This is
one reason we are locating some specific VoIP work outside of the U.S. We may
need to do the same with current and future work in media servers should future
digital restrictions mandates also appear, such as the broadcast flags.</p>

<p>I also have recently been able to consolidate much of our separate web
resources into one place, under the new wiki. This has made it much easier to
consolidate project management overall. As part of this process, I do plan to
setup a bugzilla site to consolidate bug tracking.</p>

<p>Which particular area of the roadmap gets attention will depend on where we
happen to find time, funding, and resources.</p>
