<h1 class="center">GNU Free Call GUI</h1>
</div>

<p>GNU Free Call will be a secured peer-to-peer mesh networking SIP-phone based
on GNU SIP Witch. Here is an illustration by Haakon Meland Eriksen.</p>

<p>The illustration tries to convey the idea that nearby phones with GNU Free
Call acts as intermediaries between the volunteer and the doctor after a
natural disaster. Cell phone towers are often physically destroyed, loose power
and those that still work experience overload as people try to contact each
other. Using the phones to create secured peer-to-peer mesh calling networks
will hopefully make it possible to get through.</p>

<h2>Discovering the people around you</h2>

<p>Given its decentralized nature, users need an easy way to find contacts and
new potential contacts. Here is one idea, based on the OLPC project's Sugar
interface, but rather than people meeting around activities people discover
each other around tag clouds.</p>

<h3>Main screen</h3>

<p>The main screen initially shows the GNU Free Call logo with the buttons
&ldquo;You&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fellow GNUs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Discover Hurd&rdquo;
below. Clicking the buttons brings the user to one of the three main screens.
The logo part may be used to show who you are talking to in a video
conversation - double tap the video to zoom to full screen.</p>

<h3>You</h3>

<p>At the top of the You-screen is a live search box with the default text set
to &ldquo;Search You...&rdquo; and a single GNU-icon to identify the
You-screen. Searching starts as you type, and the list of tags below shortens
as you home in on the wanted item.</p>

<p>Information about you is stored as tag clouds, with separate privacy
settings for each cloud or individual items in a cloud. There are three
visibility setting - You, GNUs and Hurd. To the right of the tag name is a
green dot in the You-column, which means only you can see it. You can slide
this to the right, and make it visible to friends and contacts - the
GNUs-column. You can slide it into the Hurd-column to let everyone see it.</p>

<h4>Sharing secrets</h4>

<p>First time round, your secret key and your public key are generated. These
are used to secretly share information, like images.</p>

<p>Your secret key is used to unlock secrets sent to you. It is red and you
cannot slide it to the right. This is to prevent you from accidentally sharing
it. However, you can override this in the advanced settings.</p>

<p>Your public key is used by others to send you secrets. It is green and
initially visible to Fellow GNUs - your friends and contacts. You can slide it
left so only you can see it, or you can slide it right so anyone can see it.
Public keys visible to you are stored, so you can send secrets to friends and
contacts.</p>

<p>To share for instance an image, simply tap the image to display its menu and
choose &ldquo;Share secretly with...&rdquo; You select the contacts you want,
and the image is duplicated and encrypted with your contacts public keys. They
appear as a list of contact names below the original image and are initially
only visible to you as yellow dots in the You-column. You slide it into
GNUs-column to make it visible to your contacts. Your contacts use their secret
key to view it.</p>

<h3>Fellow GNUs</h3>

<p>Contacts with information shown to you by your contacts. Adding a contact
will automatically import the contact's public key, which you use to send
secrets that only your contact's secret key can open. Search their tags. Tags
may be truncated when the phone is in a vertical position, these should expand
when the phone is in a horizontal position.</p>

<h3>Discover Hurd</h3>

<p>People or services with tags you can browse like directory or search
for.</p>

<p>Rather than writing &ldquo;Discover herd&rdquo;, I've taken some artistic
freedom and written &ldquo;Discover Hurd&rdquo;. This is on purpose and in
reference and homage to the architecture of the GNU/Hurd system. The basic
nature of the GNU/Hurd system is decentralized, distributed and user-centric,
and I felt that was applicable to GNU Free Call too - more user freedom. You
can use Arch Hurd to try a GNU/Hurd system and discover how it works.</p>

<h2>Designers look here - SVG</h2>

<p>GNU Free Call decentralized GUI plain SVG is available <em>[unavailable in
2017]</em>; feel free to improve it. Inkscape was used originally.</p>

<h2>Android prototype</h2>

<p>Haakon needed an Android prototype of the GUI to interact with to think of
problems with the design and to more easily explain to people how this is
supposed to work. Pimm Hogeling quickly put together an Android app showing the
main screen with the three buttons, and the three sub-screens with a tag search
field and some tags. NOTE: THE APP DOES NOT WORK &ndash; you cannot call with
it &ndash; it is for illustration purposes only.</p>

<p>Pimm's illustration prototype is available here: <a
href="https://github.com/Pimm/GNU-Free-Call-prototype">
https://github.com/Pimm/GNU-Free-Call-prototype</a>.</p>

<p>You need a file manager app to move it onto your phone. It was made to fit
on Haakon's HTC Desire.</p>

<h2>Identified problems with the design</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Thinking about a medication tag and an allergy tag - how to restrict
showing these to only one Fellow GNU, like a doctor or hospital?</li>
 <li>Drop the sub-screen title and put the search field there?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other designs are possible and suggestions are welcome</h2>

<p>We are interested in designs that give the widest range of users easy,
consistant navigation &ndash; think emergency.</p>
