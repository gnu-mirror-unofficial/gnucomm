<h1>GNU Free Call Awarded</h1>
</div>

<p><strong>From GNU Telephony</strong></p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 22nd, 2011</p>

<p>Driv Inkubator and the Norwegian Competence Center for Open Source today
awarded the GNU Free Call project 100 000 Norwegian kroner (17500 USD) for best
eHealth solution using Free Software in their annual competition. This award
has been presented to project coordinator Haakon Meland Eriksen and project
architect David Sugar. Mr. Eriksen was present to receive the award during the
GoOpen conference being held in Oslo.</p>

<p>GNU Free Call is a new project to develop and deploy secure self-organized
communication services worldwide for private use and for public administration,
and it will be released as Free (as in freedom) Software. GoOpen is a
publicly-funded conference about using Free and Open Source Software for
sharing.</p>

<p>It is often a challenge to provide basic humanitarian and medical care in
stressed environments. Medical personal need to communicate, and to do so
privately with regard to the dignity of their patients. In times of national
emergency the communications infrastructure is often broken, and our goal is to
address this through the development and deployment of self-organizing mesh
calling networks. These can be built on the existing GNU SIP Witch package and
deployed through IP capable cell phones and low cost FreedomBox servers, as
well as through traditional locally connected desktop and laptop computers. Put
simply – eHealth through a secured healthnet of cell phones.</p>

<p>Free Software means that the program's users have the four essential
freedoms:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
 <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do
  what you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for
  this.</li>
 <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom
  2).</li>
 <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
  (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
  benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
  this.</li>
</ul>
